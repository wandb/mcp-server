I have a question regarding artifacts. I have deleted the data artifacts i've uploaded previously on wandb UI. I have uploaded new data. but seems like while using the new data artifacts (image paths) for future use, wandb is somehow returning the previously deleted paths.", "answer": "The issue you're encountering is likely due to how Weights & Biases handles deleted artifacts. When you delete artifacts in the W&B UI, they are initially **soft-deleted**. Soft-deleted artifacts are not immediately removed from the system; instead, they undergo garbage collection before being permanently deleted (hard-deleted). This means that references to these artifacts might still exist temporarily, which could explain why you're seeing paths from previously deleted artifacts.\n\n### Steps to Resolve:\n\n1. **Check for Soft-Deleted Artifacts**:\n   - If the artifacts are still in the soft-deleted state, they might still be referenced. You can wait for the garbage collection process to complete, which will permanently remove the artifacts.\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Artifact References**:\n   - Verify that your code is referencing the new artifact and not the old one. Double-check the artifact name and alias you're using in your code.\n\n3. **Clear Local Cache**:\n   - W&B caches artifacts locally to optimize performance. If the cache contains references to the old artifacts, you might encounter this issue. You can clear the local cache using the following command:\n     ```bash\n     wandb artifact cache cleanup\n     ```\n\n4. **Programmatically Verify Artifacts**:\n   - Use the W&B API to list and verify the artifacts currently available in your project. This will help ensure that you're working with the correct artifact versions. Here's an example:\n     ```python\n     import wandb\n\n     api = wandb.Api()\n     project = \"your_project_name\"\n     entity = \"your_entity_name\"\n\n     # List all artifacts in the project\n     artifacts = api.artifacts(type=\"dataset\", project=project, entity=entity)\n     for artifact in artifacts:\n         print(f\"Artifact: {artifact.name}, Aliases: {artifact.aliases}\")\n     ```\n\n5. **Force Garbage Collection**:\n   - If you're hosting W&B on-premises, ensure that garbage collection is enabled. For cloud-hosted W&B, garbage collection is enabled by default. If needed, you can configure garbage collection by setting the `GORILLA_ARTIFACT_GC_ENABLED` environment variable to `true`.\n\n6. **Re-upload the New Artifact**:\n   - If the issue persists, try re-uploading the new artifact with a unique name or alias to avoid conflicts with the old artifact.\n\n### Example of Using the Correct Artifact:\nEnsure you're using the correct artifact in your code:\n```python\nimport wandb\n\nrun = wandb.init(project=\"your_project_name\", job_type=\"use-dataset\")\nartifact = run.use_artifact(\"new_dataset:latest\")  # Ensure this is the correct artifact\ndataset_path = artifact.download()\nprint(f\"Dataset downloaded to: {dataset_path}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Soft Deletion**: Deleted artifacts are not immediately removed but are marked for deletion and undergo garbage collection.\n- **Cache**: Local caching might still reference old artifacts, so clearing the cache can resolve the issue.\n- **Artifact Aliases**: Ensure you're using the correct alias (e.g., `latest`) to reference the new artifact.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and ensure that W&B references the correct artifact paths.\n\n**Sources**:\n- [Delete Artifacts](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts/delete-artifacts)\n- [Download and Use Artifacts](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts/download-and-use-an-artifact)", "model": "gpt-4o-2024-11-20", "sources": "https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts/artifacts-faqs\nhttps://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts/delete-artifacts\nhttps://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts/delete-artifacts\nhttps://wandb.ai/aarora/reports/reports/--VmlldzoxMTc1ODk4\nhttps://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts/update-an-artifact\nhttps://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts/artifacts-faqs\nhttps://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts/delete-artifacts\nhttps://wandb.ai/andrea0/azure-2023/reports/--Vmlldzo0NDA2NDgw\nhttps://github.com/wandb/edu/tree/main/llm-apps-course/docs_sample/dataset-versioning.md\nhttps://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts/\nhttps://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts/track-external-files\nhttps://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/add-wandb-to-any-library\nhttps://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts/delete-artifacts\nhttps://docs.wandb.ai/ref/cli/wandb-artifact/\nhttps://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts/download-and-use-an-artifact", "source_documents": "source: https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts/artifacts-faqs\nsource_type: documentation\nhas_code: False\n\n## Artifacts FAQs\n\nFrequently Asked Questions About Artifacts  \n\nThe proceeding questions are commonly asked questions about W&B Artifacts and W&B Artifact workflows.  \n\n## Questions about Artifacts  \n\n### Who has access to my artifacts?  \n\nArtifacts inherit the access to their parent project:  \n\n* If the project is private, then only members of the project's team have access to its artifacts.\n* For public projects, all users have read access to artifacts but only members of the project's team can create or modify them.\n* For open projects, all users have read and write access to artifacts.  \n\n## Questions about Artifacts workflows  \n\nThis section describes workflows for managing and editing Artifacts.

With W&B, you can track references to data and models stored in Azure Blob Storage. The artifact references essentially abstract away the underlying cloud storage vendor, allowing for seamless integration into your existing data architecture.  \n\nFor example, if you're working with a blob storage structure similar to my-bucket/classic_data for your dataset and my-bucket/models/cnn/ for your models, tracking these resources with W&B is a breeze.  \n\nHere's an example of how you might create an Artifact that references your dataset stored in Azure Blob Storage:\n\n---\n\nsource: https://github.com/wandb/edu/tree/main/llm-apps-course/docs_sample/dataset-versioning.md\nsource_type: markdown\nhas_code: False\n\n---  \n\n## description: Guide to using Artifacts for dataset versioning  \n\n# Dataset Versioning  \n\nVersion datasets with W&B Artifacts.  \n\nW&B Artifacts help you save and organize machine learning datasets throughout a project's lifecycle.  \n\n### Common use cases  \n\n1. **Version data seamlessly**, without interrupting your workflow\n2. **Prepackage data splits**, like training, validation, and test sets\n3. **Iteratively refine datasets**, without desynchronizing the team\n4. **Juggle multiple datasets**, as in fine-tuning and domain adaptation\n5. **Visualize & share your data workflow**, keeping all your work in one place  \n\n### Flexible tracking and hosting  \n\nBeyond these common scenarios, you can use core Artifact features to upload, version, alias, compare, and download data, supporting any custom dataset workflow on local or remote file systems, via S3, GCP, or https.  \n\n## Core Artifacts features  \n\nW&B Artifacts support dataset versioning through these basic features:  \n\n## Version data seamlessly\n\n---\n\nsource: https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts/\nsource_type: documentation\nhas_code: False\n\n## Artifacts\n### How it works\nCreate an artifact with four lines of code:\n1. Create a W&B run.\n2. Create an artifact object with the `wandb.Artifact` API.\n3. Add one or more files, such as a model file or dataset, to your artifact object.\n4. Log your artifact to W&B.  \n\n`python showLineNumbers\nrun = wandb.init(project=\"artifacts-example\", job_type=\"add-dataset\")\nartifact = wandb.Artifact(name=\"my_data\", type=\"dataset\")\nartifact.add_dir(local_path=\"./dataset.h5\") # Add dataset directory to artifact\nrun.log_artifact(artifact) # Logs the artifact version \"my_data:v0\"`  \n\n:::tip\nThe preceding code snippet, and the colab linked on this page, show how to track files by uploading them to W&B. See the track external files page for information on how to add references to files or directories that are stored in external object storage (for example, in an Amazon S3 bucket).\n:::\n\n---\n\nsource: https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts/track-external-files\nsource_type: documentation\nhas_code: False\n\n## Track external files\n### Track artifacts outside of W&B\n#### Filesystem References\nBy default, W&B imposes a 10,000 file limit when adding a reference to a directory. You can adjust this limit by specifying `max_objects=` in calls to `add_reference`.  \n\nNote the triple slash in the URL. The first component is the `file://` prefix that denotes the use of filesystem references. The second is the path to our dataset, `/mount/datasets/mnist/`.  \n\nThe resulting artifact `mnist:latest` looks and acts just like a regular artifact. The only difference is that the artifact only consists of metadata about the files, such as their sizes and MD5 checksums. The files themselves never leave your system.  \n\nYou can interact with this artifact just as you would a normal artifact. In the UI, you can browse the contents of the reference artifact using the file browser, explore the full dependency graph, and scan through the versioned history of your artifact. However, the UI will not be able to render rich media such as images, audio, etc. as the data itself is not contained within the artifact.\n\n---\n\nsource: https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/add-wandb-to-any-library\nsource_type: documentation\nhas_code: True\n\n## Add wandb to Any Library\n#### Logging Model Checkpoints And More\n##### Download A W&B Artifact\n```\nartifact = wandb.run.use\\_artifact(\u201cuser/project/artifact:latest\u201d)\nlocal\\_path = artifact.download(\u201c./tmp\u201d)\n\n```  \n\nArtifacts can be found in the Artifacts section of W&B and can be referenced with aliases generated automatically (\u201clatest\u201d, \u201cv2\u201d, \u201cv3\u201d) or manually when logging (\u201cbest\\_accuracy\u201d\u2026).  \n\nTo download an Artifact without creating a `wandb` run (through `wandb.init`), for example in distributed environments or for simple inference, you can instead reference the artifact with the wandb API:  \n\n```\nartifact = wandb.Api().artifact(\u201cuser/project/artifact:latest\u201d)\nlocal\\_path = artifact.download()\n\n```  \n\nFor more information, see Download and Use Artifacts.\n\n---\n\nsource: https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts/delete-artifacts\nsource_type: documentation\nhas_code: False\n\n## Delete artifacts\n### How to enable garbage collection based on how W&B is hosted\n\nGarbage collection is enabled by default if you use W&B's shared cloud. Based on how you host W&B, you might need to take additional steps to enable garbage collection, this includes:  \n\n* Set the `GORILLA_ARTIFACT_GC_ENABLED` environment variable to true: `GORILLA_ARTIFACT_GC_ENABLED=true`\n* Enable bucket versioning if you use AWS, GCP or any other storage provider such as Minio. If you use Azure, enable soft deletion.\n:::note\nSoft deletion in Azure is equivalent to bucket versioning in other storage providers.\n:::  \n\nThe following table describes how to satisfy requirements to enable garbage collection based on your deployment type.  \n\nThe `X` indicates you must satisfy the requirement:\n\n---\n\nsource: https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/cli/wandb-artifact/\nsource_type: documentation\nhas_code: False\n\n## wandb artifact\n\n**Usage**  \n\n`wandb artifact [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...`  \n\n**Summary**  \n\nCommands for interacting with artifacts  \n\n**Options**  \n\n| **Option** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |  \n\n**Commands**  \n\n| **Command** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- |\n| cache | Commands for interacting with the artifact cache |\n| get | Download an artifact from wandb |\n| ls | List all artifacts in a wandb project |\n| put | Upload an artifact to wandb |\n\n---\n\nsource: https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts/download-and-use-an-artifact\nsource_type: documentation\nhas_code: True\n\n## Download and use artifacts\n\nDownload and use artifacts  \n\nDownload and use an artifact that is already stored on the W&B server or construct an artifact object and pass it in to be deduplicated as necessary.  \n\n:::note\nTeam members with view-only seats cannot download artifacts.\n:::  \n\n### Download and use an artifact stored on W&B  \n\nDownload and use an artifact that is stored in W&B either inside or outside of a W&B Run. Use the Public API (`wandb.Api`) to export (or update data) already saved in W&B. For more information, see the W&B Public API Reference guide.  \n\nFirst, import the W&B Python SDK. Next, create a W&B Run:  \n\n```\nimport wandb\n\nrun = wandb.init(project=\"<example>\", job\\_type=\"<job-type>\")\n\n```  \n\nIndicate the artifact you want to use with the `use_artifact` method.

Many of these workflows use the W&B API, the component of our client library which provides access to data stored with W&B.  \n\n### How do I log an artifact to an existing run?  \n\n### How do I set a retention or expiration policy on my artifact?  \n\n### How do I best log models from runs in a sweep?\n\n---\n\nsource: https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts/delete-artifacts\nsource_type: documentation\nhas_code: True\n\n## Delete artifacts\n#### Delete an artifact collection\n\nTo delete an artifact collection:  \n\n1. Navigate to the artifact collection you want to delete and hover over it.\n2. Select the kebab dropdown next to the artifact collection name.\n3. Choose Delete.  \n\nYou can also delete artifact version programmatically with the delete() method. Provide the name of the project and entity for the `project` and `entity` keys in `wandb.Api`, respectively. Replace the `<>` with the name of your artifact:  \n\n```\nimport wandb\n\n# Provide your entity and a project name when you\n# use wandb.Api methods.\napi = wandb.Api(overrides={\"project\": \"project\", \"entity\": \"entity\"})\n\nartifact\\_name = \"<>\"  # provide artifact name\nartifact = api.artifact(artifact\\_name)\nartifact.collection.delete()\n\n```\n\n---\n\nsource: https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts/delete-artifacts\nsource_type: documentation\nhas_code: False\n\n## Delete artifacts\n:::note\nArtifacts that are scheduled for deletion with a TTL policy, deleted with the W&B SDK, or deleted with the W&B App UI are first soft-deleted.

Choose Delete.  \n\nAn artifact version can also be deleted programatically via the delete() method. See the examples below.  \n\n### Delete multiple artifact versions with aliases  \n\nThe following code example demonstrates how to delete artifacts that have aliases associated with them. Provide the entity, project name, and run ID that created the artifacts.  \n\n### Delete multiple artifact versions with a specific alias\n\n---\n\nsource: https://wandb.ai/aarora/reports/reports/--VmlldzoxMTc1ODk4\nsource_type: report\nhas_code: True\n\n## How Weights and Biases Can Help with Audits & Regulatory Guidelines\n### What are W&B Artifacts?\n> W&B Artifacts was designed to make it effortless to version your datasets and models, regardless of whether you want to store your files with W&B or whether you already have a bucket you want W&B to track. Once you've tracked your datasets or model files, W&B will automatically log each and every modification, giving you a complete and auditable history of changes to your files.  \n\nThis lets you focus on the fun and important parts of evolving your datasets and training your models, while W&B handles the otherwise tedious process of tracking all the details.  \n\nGreat! Weights and Biases can take care of versioning and storage for us. But what's the benefit?  \n\n>  \n\nIt's really easy to log wandb artifacts using 4 simple lines of code:  \n\n```\nwandb.init()\nartifact = wandb.Artifact(<enter_filename>, type='model')\nartifact.add_file(<file_path>)\nwandb.run.log_artifact(artifact)\n```\n\n---\n\nsource: https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts/update-an-artifact\nsource_type: documentation\nhas_code: True\n\n## Update artifacts\n```\nimport wandb\n\napi = wandb.Api()\n\nartifact = api.artifact(\"entity/project/artifact:alias\")\n\n# Update the description\nartifact.description = \"My new description\"\n\n# Selectively update metadata keys\nartifact.metadata[\"oldKey\"] = \"new value\"\n\n# Replace the metadata entirely\nartifact.metadata = {\"newKey\": \"new value\"}\n\n# Add an alias\nartifact.aliases.append(\"best\")\n\n# Remove an alias\nartifact.aliases.remove(\"latest\")\n\n# Completely replace the aliases\nartifact.aliases = [\"replaced\"]\n\n# Persist all artifact modifications\nartifact.save()\n\n```  \n\nFor more information, see the Weights and Biases Artifact API.\n\n---\n\nsource: https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts/artifacts-faqs\nsource_type: documentation\nhas_code: True\n\n## Artifacts FAQs\n### Questions about Artifacts workflows\n#### How can I find the artifacts logged or consumed by a run?

With W&B, you can track references to data and models stored in Azure Blob Storage. The artifact references essentially abstract away the underlying cloud storage vendor, allowing for seamless integration into your existing data architecture.  \n\nFor example, if you're working with a blob storage structure similar to my-bucket/classic_data for your dataset and my-bucket/models/cnn/ for your models, tracking these resources with W&B is a breeze.  \n\nHere's an example of how you might create an Artifact that references your dataset stored in Azure Blob Storage:\n\n---\n\nsource: https://github.com/wandb/edu/tree/main/llm-apps-course/docs_sample/dataset-versioning.md\nsource_type: markdown\nhas_code: False\n\n---  \n\n## description: Guide to using Artifacts for dataset versioning  \n\n# Dataset Versioning  \n\nVersion datasets with W&B Artifacts.  \n\nW&B Artifacts help you save and organize machine learning datasets throughout a project's lifecycle.  \n\n### Common use cases  \n\n1. **Version data seamlessly**, without interrupting your workflow\n2. **Prepackage data splits**, like training, validation, and test sets\n3. **Iteratively refine datasets**, without desynchronizing the team\n4. **Juggle multiple datasets**, as in fine-tuning and domain adaptation\n5. **Visualize & share your data workflow**, keeping all your work in one place  \n\n### Flexible tracking and hosting  \n\nBeyond these common scenarios, you can use core Artifact features to upload, version, alias, compare, and download data, supporting any custom dataset workflow on local or remote file systems, via S3, GCP, or https.  \n\n## Core Artifacts features  \n\nW&B Artifacts support dataset versioning through these basic features:  \n\n## Version data seamlessly\n\n---\n\nsource: https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts/\nsource_type: documentation\nhas_code: False\n\n## Artifacts\n### How it works\nCreate an artifact with four lines of code:\n1. Create a W&B run.\n2. Create an artifact object with the `wandb.Artifact` API.\n3. Add one or more files, such as a model file or dataset, to your artifact object.\n4. Log your artifact to W&B.  \n\n`python showLineNumbers\nrun = wandb.init(project=\"artifacts-example\", job_type=\"add-dataset\")\nartifact = wandb.Artifact(name=\"my_data\", type=\"dataset\")\nartifact.add_dir(local_path=\"./dataset.h5\") # Add dataset directory to artifact\nrun.log_artifact(artifact) # Logs the artifact version \"my_data:v0\"`  \n\n:::tip\nThe preceding code snippet, and the colab linked on this page, show how to track files by uploading them to W&B. See the track external files page for information on how to add references to files or directories that are stored in external object storage (for example, in an Amazon S3 bucket).\n:::\n\n---\n\nsource: https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts/track-external-files\nsource_type: documentation\nhas_code: False\n\n## Track external files\n### Track artifacts outside of W&B\n#### Filesystem References\nBy default, W&B imposes a 10,000 file limit when adding a reference to a directory. You can adjust this limit by specifying `max_objects=` in calls to `add_reference`.  \n\nNote the triple slash in the URL. The first component is the `file://` prefix that denotes the use of filesystem references. The second is the path to our dataset, `/mount/datasets/mnist/`.  \n\nThe resulting artifact `mnist:latest` looks and acts just like a regular artifact. The only difference is that the artifact only consists of metadata about the files, such as their sizes and MD5 checksums. The files themselves never leave your system.  \n\nYou can interact with this artifact just as you would a normal artifact. In the UI, you can browse the contents of the reference artifact using the file browser, explore the full dependency graph, and scan through the versioned history of your artifact. However, the UI will not be able to render rich media such as images, audio, etc. as the data itself is not contained within the artifact.\n\n---\n\nsource: https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/add-wandb-to-any-library\nsource_type: documentation\nhas_code: True\n\n## Add wandb to Any Library\n#### Logging Model Checkpoints And More\n##### Download A W&B Artifact\n```\nartifact = wandb.run.use\\_artifact(\u201cuser/project/artifact:latest\u201d)\nlocal\\_path = artifact.download(\u201c./tmp\u201d)\n\n```  \n\nArtifacts can be found in the Artifacts section of W&B and can be referenced with aliases generated automatically (\u201clatest\u201d, \u201cv2\u201d, \u201cv3\u201d) or manually when logging (\u201cbest\\_accuracy\u201d\u2026).  \n\nTo download an Artifact without creating a `wandb` run (through `wandb.init`), for example in distributed environments or for simple inference, you can instead reference the artifact with the wandb API:  \n\n```\nartifact = wandb.Api().artifact(\u201cuser/project/artifact:latest\u201d)\nlocal\\_path = artifact.download()\n\n```  \n\nFor more information, see Download and Use Artifacts.\n\n---\n\nsource: https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts/delete-artifacts\nsource_type: documentation\nhas_code: False\n\n## Delete artifacts\n### How to enable garbage collection based on how W&B is hosted\n\nGarbage collection is enabled by default if you use W&B's shared cloud. Based on how you host W&B, you might need to take additional steps to enable garbage collection, this includes:  \n\n* Set the `GORILLA_ARTIFACT_GC_ENABLED` environment variable to true: `GORILLA_ARTIFACT_GC_ENABLED=true`\n* Enable bucket versioning if you use AWS, GCP or any other storage provider such as Minio. If you use Azure, enable soft deletion.\n:::note\nSoft deletion in Azure is equivalent to bucket versioning in other storage providers.\n:::  \n\nThe following table describes how to satisfy requirements to enable garbage collection based on your deployment type.  \n\nThe `X` indicates you must satisfy the requirement:\n\n---\n\nsource: https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/cli/wandb-artifact/\nsource_type: documentation\nhas_code: False\n\n## wandb artifact\n\n**Usage**  \n\n`wandb artifact [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...`  \n\n**Summary**  \n\nCommands for interacting with artifacts  \n\n**Options**  \n\n| **Option** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |  \n\n**Commands**  \n\n| **Command** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- |\n| cache | Commands for interacting with the artifact cache |\n| get | Download an artifact from wandb |\n| ls | List all artifacts in a wandb project |\n| put | Upload an artifact to wandb |\n\n---\n\nsource: https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts/download-and-use-an-artifact\nsource_type: documentation\nhas_code: True\n\n## Download and use artifacts\n\nDownload and use artifacts  \n\nDownload and use an artifact that is already stored on the W&B server or construct an artifact object and pass it in to be deduplicated as necessary.  \n\n:::note\nTeam members with view-only seats cannot download artifacts.\n:::  \n\n### Download and use an artifact stored on W&B  \n\nDownload and use an artifact that is stored in W&B either inside or outside of a W&B Run. Use the Public API (`wandb.Api`) to export (or update data) already saved in W&B. For more information, see the W&B Public API Reference guide.  \n\nFirst, import the W&B Python SDK. Next, create a W&B Run:  \n\n```\nimport wandb\n\nrun = wandb.init(project=\"<example>\", job\\_type=\"<job-type>\")\n\n```  \n\nIndicate the artifact you want to use with the `use_artifact` method. This returns a run object.
